// Today we learnt about how to add integers together and alos including strings within the output. This allows me to use both stings and integers together to create mixed outputs.

string firstName = "Bob";
int widgetsSold = 7;
Console.WriteLine(firstName + " sold " + (widgetsSold + 7) + " widgets.");
